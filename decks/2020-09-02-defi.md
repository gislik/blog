The main idea is to extend the use-cases of public blockchains to not only offer cryptocurrency as a form of money but to encompass more complex financial transactions.

  Use cases:

- Stable coins
- Spot and derivates trading
- Credit facilities and money markets
- Insurance
- Prediction markets
- Staking
