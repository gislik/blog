# #DeFi
## Decentralized finance

<section>
The main idea is to extend the use-cases of public blockchains to not only offer cryptocurrency as a form of money but to encompass more complex financial transactions
</section>

<section>
#### Use cases

- Stable coins
- Spot and derivates trading
- Credit facilities and money markets
- Insurance
- Prediction markets
- Staking
</section>

<section>
DeFi is still highly experimental and there are _huge_ risks associated with various platforms, people will lose money and there will be crying
</section>

<section>
However, it might also bring real innovation, just like not all the ICO projects turned out to be scams
</section>
</section>

<section>
<section>
#### Liquidity mining
The central idea is that you earn yield by providing liquidity to other participants
</section>

<section>
Early protocols used order books but automatic market makers are winning

- Dharma vs Compound
- 0x vs Uniswap
</section>

<section>
Liquidity is provided by locking tokens in a smart contract

\[ token_A * token_B = K \]
</section>

<section>

\[ y  = \frac{k}{x} \implies \Delta P = \frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{k}{x^2}  \]
</section>

<section>
Arbitrageurs are incentivized to keep the the pool balanced

LPs receive Liquidity Tokens
</p>
</section>

<section>
The main metric to watch is the Total Value Locked

| 2020 | TVL $MM |
|------|---------|
| Jan  | 690     |
| Feb  | 1,000   |
| July | 2,000   |
| Sept | 9,000+  |
