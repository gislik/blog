title: The road to 10,000,000 tx/sec
reveal: true
theme: blood
summary: |
  Current blockchain architectures are limited by the blockchain trilemma, which states that only two of the following properties can be achieved; decentralization, security and scalability. As a result, scalability can only be achieved by sacrificing either decentralization or security. A new architecture, which breaks the monolithic design into specialized components of consensus, execution and data availability, reverses the blockchain trilemma. Based on this new understanding, is it conceivable that blockchains, will be able to support the world's economic activity without scarifying important properties?

A turmoil around the number of couriers required to carry bags of checks and stock certificates caused a paper crunch and the exchange to extend the settlement period to five days

Wall Street began to envision a more efficient settlement process led by electronic means. Then in 2001, the attacks of 9/11 further proved the vulnerability of paper stock certificates, when vaults of them incinerated with the demolition of the World Trade Cent
