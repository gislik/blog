  Gisli, CTO of Monerium, will demonstrate how a wallet IBAN works and how blockchain platforms can enable, for free, seamless Euro transfers between banks and their users' blockchain wallets without going through exchanges. Gisli will send Euros from a bank account to a wallet in under 30 seconds. The Euros are stored as EURe, the first authorized ERC20 e-money on blockchains. Gisli will also show how platforms like Request Network allow users to send invoices that can be paid using a bank account or crypto.
