    <h4>Definition</h4>
    An intent is signed a set of **declarative constraints** which allow a user to outsource transaction creation to a third party without relinquishing full control to the transacting party.

    If a transaction explicitly refers to **how** an action should be performed, an intent refers to **what** the desired outcome of that action should be. 

    If a transaction says _“do A then B, pay exactly C to get X back”_, an intent says _“I want X and I’m willing to pay up to C”_.
