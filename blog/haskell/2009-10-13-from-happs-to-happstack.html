<p>I have been dreading porting my Blog application from <em>HAppS</em> to <a href="happstack.com"><em>Happstack</em></a> for a long time now. It is however apparent that <em>HAppS</em> is dying and <em>Happstack</em> (a fork of <em>HAppS</em> designed to take things further) was the only way to roll.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>... a refreshingly innovative web application server written in Haskell. Leveraging the MACID state system, Happstack offers robust and scalable data access without the headache of managing a traditional RDBMS such as MySQL.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.darcsweb.com:5003/r/mae/happstack-stable/snapshot/current/content/pretty/happstack/RELEASE_NOTES">RELEASE_NOTES</a> file had some guidelines for porting existing applications to <em>Happstack</em>. In my case it turned out to be really easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <em>Happstack </em> 
<ul>
<li>
<pre>sudo cabal install happstack</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change <em>HAppS</em> to <em>Happstack</em> in all .hs-files           
<ul>
<li>
<pre>find . -type f -name '*.hs' -exec sed -i.bak 's/HAppS/Happstack/g' {} \;</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change&nbsp;unServerPartT to&nbsp;runServerPartT           
<ul>
<li>
<pre>
find . -type f -name '*.hs' -exec sed -i.bak 's/unServerPartT/runServerPartT/g' {} \;
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change all instances of [ServerPartT m a] to ServerPartT with <em>msum</em></li>
<li>Compile my code again</li>
</ol>
<p>Well this sounds almost too easy. And it is. I alway got the error <em>Unsupported socket</em> - both on my Mac (development machine) and on my Linux box (the production machine). On <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/HAppS/msg/0c9a0d0fd7c6aff0"><em>Google Groups</em></a> I found someone saying that it's a problem with how <em>Haskell's Templating System</em> handles &nbsp;<em>IPv6. </em>The solution was to change <em>Happstack.Server.HTTP.Socket.acceptLite</em> to:</p>
<div>
<pre>-- | alternative implementation of accept to work around EAI_AGAIN errors 
acceptLite :: S.Socket -&gt; IO (Handle, S.HostName, S.PortNumber) 
acceptLite sock = do 
  (sock', addr) &lt;- S.accept sock 
  h &lt;- S.socketToHandle sock' ReadWriteMode 
  (N.PortNumber p) &lt;- N.socketPort sock' 

<p>  let peer = case addr of 
               (S.SockAddrInet _ ha)      -showHostAddress ha 
               (S.SockAddrInet6 _ _ ha _) -showHostAddress6 ha 
               _                          -error "Unsupported socket"</p>
<p>  return (h, peer, p) </p>
</pre>
<p>Actually I used the time to cabalize my code. Outlining the dependencies means that <em><a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal">Cabal</a></em> takes care of downloading all the necessary packages. To date my cabal file looks like this:</p>

<pre>
name:                gisliblog<br/>
version:             0.0
synopsis:            Personal website
description:         
category:            Web
license:             BSD3
license-file:        LICENSE
author:              G&iacute;sli Kristj&aacute;nsson
maintainer:          gislik hamstur.is
build-depends:       base,feed,nano-md5,hscolour,json,curl,HStringTemplate,happstack
build-type:          Simple
hs-source-dirs:      src
executable:          gisli.hamstur.is
main-is:             src/Main.hs
ghc-options:         -isrc        
</pre>

<p>Also having everything in a <em><a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a></em>&nbsp;repository meant that I could port the code in a special branch and merge the branches when the code compiled successfully. The next steps are to port my brothers photo site to <em>Happstack</em> and then look into taking the advantage of the new API which has been simplified in many ways. For example</p>
<p>This:</p>
<pre>
    uriRest :: Monad m =&gt; (String -&gt; ServerPartT m a) -&gt; ServerPartT m a
    uriRest handle = withRequest $ \rq -&gt; unServerPartT (handle (rqURL rq)) rq
</pre>
<p>Becomes this:</p>
<pre>
    uriRest :: (ServerMonad m, Monad m) =&gt; (String -&gt; m a) -&gt; m a
    uriRest handle = askRq &gt;&gt;= handle . rqURL</pre>
<p>That's it for now.</p>
<p>P.S. On a different note I just placed an order for the <em>Arduino Duemilanove</em> microcontroller board. It should be arriving this week. I'm all excited so the next blog could be about that.</p>
