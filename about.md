title: "Turning ☕️ into ⚡️"
---

With an academic background in mathematics, an interest in software and a working experience in financial markets I have found my sweet spot; **code** and **crypto**. This includes permissionless blockchains, cryptography, cryptocurrency and software. I strongly believe that they are a fundamental technology and a social layer on which we will build the next wave of social contracts such as money and financial transactions.

Ever since reading my first programming book as a kid I have been drawn towards the art of writing code. Connecting to a BBS over the land line using a modem and later to the Internet was magical. It always felt like in cyber space you could do anything -- and it still feels that way. At the same time open source was coming of age. The tension between believers and non-believers was almost like a cold war -- a sentiment all to present in today's crypto market. Now nothing feels more natural and even then arch-enemy Microsoft has embraced open source and Linux runs on ¾ of all mobile phones.

Most of my time I spend between the family and working on my [second startup](https://monerium.com) which aims to close the gap between the traditional financial world and the brave new world.

Despite my affection for software I have probably written enough content management systems for a lifetime. That is why this website is simply generated from Markdown files in a git [repo](https://github.com/gislik/gisli.hamstur.is). This way it is both simpler and more fun working on the actual content.
